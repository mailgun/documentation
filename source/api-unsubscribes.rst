Unsubscribes
============

Mailgun allows you to quickly add "Unsubscribe me" feature to your outgoing
emails without any programming on your end. You can enable this in your
Control Panel under your domain settings.

Mailgun can :ref:`notify your application <webhooks>` every time a
user unsubscribes.

This API allows you to programmatically download the list of recipients who have
unsubscribed from your emails. You can also programmatically "clear" the
unsubscribe event.
