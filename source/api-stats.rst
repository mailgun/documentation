Stats
=====

Mailgun collects many different events and
generates event statistics which are available in your Control Panel.
This data is also available via an API.

The statistics are calculated in hourly, daily and monthly resolution in UTC timezone.

The following retention policy is applied to the statistics:

- Hourly stats are preserved for a month.
- Daily stats are preserved for a year.
- Monthly stats are stored throughout the lifespan of the domain.
