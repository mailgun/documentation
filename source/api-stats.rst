Stats

generates event statistics which are available in your Control Panel.
This data is also available via our stats API endpoint. The stats endpoint is available at:

The statistics are calculated in hourly, daily and monthly resolution in UTC timezone.

.. code-block:: url

Data Retention
--------------

The following retention policy is applied to the statistics:

- Hourly stats are preserved for two months.
- Daily stats are preserved for a year.
- Monthly stats are stored throughout the lifespan of the domain.

Duration
--------

Duration is a string that represents a period of time with some resolution.
It has a format ``[0-9]+[m,d,h]`` where

- ``h`` - an hour
- ``d`` - a day
- ``m`` - a month

Examples:

- `24h` - a period of 24 hours (a day) with hourly resolution
- `1d` - a period of 1 day with daily resolution
- `2m` - a period of 2 months with monthly resolution
