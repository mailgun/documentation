Introduction
############

This section documents the API endpoints that support features under the `Optimize`_ offering.

The Optimize (formally InboxReady) deliverability suite was built to be used seemlessly alongside Mailgun's email
sending platform. As such, Mailgun and Optimize share the same underlying API infrustructure,
such as authentification, REST conformity, etc. To understand the basics of the API or to get
started, see this `introduction`_.
