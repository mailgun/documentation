Email Validation/Verification
================

.. note:: Our Email Validation service has been renamed to Email Verification service. While the names are different, nothing within our codebase has changed to cause a disruption in service.

.. note:: Our Single and Bulk Email Verification service is available via the EU API.

This API endpoint is an email address verification service.

We will verify the given address based on:

- Mailbox detection

- Syntax checks (RFC defined grammar)

- DNS validation

- Spell checks

- Email Service Provider (ESP) specific local-part grammar (if available).

The Email Validation/Verification API endpoint is available at:

.. code-block:: url

      v4/address/validate

Pricing details for Mailgun's email verification service can be found on our `pricing page`_.

Mailgun's email verification service is intended to verify email addresses submitted through forms like newsletters, online registrations and shopping carts.  Refer to our `Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)`_ for more information about how to use the service appropriately.

address                  string       Email address being verified
did_you_mean             string       (Optional) Null if nothing, however if a potential typo is made to the domain, the closest suggestion is provided
is_disposable_address    boolean      If the domain is in a list of disposable email addresses, this will be appropriately categorized
is_role_address          boolean      Checks the mailbox portion of the email if it matches a specific role type ('admin', 'sales', 'webmaster')
reason                   array        List of potential reasons why a specific verification may be unsuccessful.
result                   string       Either ``deliverable``, ``undeliverable``, ``do_not_send``, ``catch_all`` or ``unknown``. Please see the Result Types section below for details on each result type.

Reason Explanation
_______

=============================    ==========================================================================================================================================================================================
Reason                           Description
=============================    ==========================================================================================================================================================================================
unknown_provider                 The MX provider is an unknown provider.
no_mx / No MX host found         The recipient domain does not have a valid MX host. `Note: this reason will be consolidated to only "no_mx" in the future.`
high_risk_domain                 Information obtained about the domain indicates it is high risk to send email to.
subdomain_mailer                 The recipient domain is identified to be a subdomain and is not on our exception list. Subdomains are considered to be high risk as many spammers and malicious actors utilize them.
immature_domain                  The domain is newly created based on the WHOIS information.
tld_risk                         The domain has a top-level-domain (TLD) that has been identified as high risk.
mailbox_does_not_exist           The mailbox is undeliverable or does not exist.
mailbox_is_disposable_address    The mailbox has been identified to be a disposable address. Disposable address are temporary, generally one time use, addresses.
mailbox_is_role_address          The mailbox is a role based address (ex. support@..., marketing@...).
catch_all                        The validity of the recipient address cannot be determined as the provider accepts any and all email regardless of whether or not the recipient’s mailbox exists.
long_term_disposable             The mailbox has been identified as a long term disposable address. Long term disposable addresses can be quickly and easily deactivated by users, but they will not expire without user intervention.
failed custom grammar check      The mailbox failed our custom ESP local-part grammar check.

Result Types
_______

=============================    ==========================================================================================================================================================================================
Reason                           Description
=============================    ==========================================================================================================================================================================================
deliverable                      The recipient address is considered to be valid and should accept email.
undeliverable                    The recipient address is considered to be invalid and will result in a bounce if sent to.
do_not_send                      The recipient address is considered to be highly risky and will negatively impact sending reputation if sent to.
catch_all                        The validity of the recipient address cannot be determined as the provider accepts any and all email regardless of whether or not the recipient’s mailbox exists.
unknown                          The validity of the recipient address cannot be determined for a variety of potential reasons. Please refer to the associated ‘reason’ array returned in the response.

Bulk Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
    Bulk Verification allows for the verification of a list of email addresses. Given a list name and an uploaded file of email addresses,
    a backend processing job will be run to verify the list. Once the verifications have all been completed, the
    results will be provided with download links.


.. note::
    It's important to upload as `multi-part/form-data` where the file is defined by `file`.

    Currently only raw `csv` and `gzip` are supported.

    The column header for emails needs to be either `email` or `email_address`

.. warning::
    Lists must comply to either UTF-8 or ASCII encoding and not have a '@' in the name.

.. code-block:: url

    GET /v4/address/validate/bulk

Get list of all bulk verification jobs.

.. code-block:: url

    POST /v4/address/validate/bulk/<list_id>

Create a bulk verification job.

.. code-block:: url

    GET /v4/address/validate/bulk/<list_id>

Check the current status of a bulk verification job.

.. code-block:: url

    DELETE /v4/address/validate/bulk/<list_id>

This endpoint can be used to cancel an in-progress bulk verification job or
delete results for a completed bulk verification job. When this endpoint is
called for an "uploaded" job, associated result files will be deleted and the
job's status will be set to "deleted".

Bulk Verification Preview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
    Bulk verification preview performs a free analysis of a list of email addresses allowing
    you to make an informed decision to run a complete bulk verification or not. Given a preview name
    and an uploaded file of email addresses, a preliminary verification run will be preformed. The results of the preview
    will be, on average, an estimate of the deliverability and risk of the emails provide. This evaluation is based
    on a statistical sampling of the list provided.


.. note::
    It's important to upload as `multi-part/form-data` where the file is defined by `file`.

    Currently only raw `csv` and `gzip` are supported.

    The column header for emails needs to be either `email` or `email_address`
