Email Validation
================

This API endpoint is an email address validation service. We will validate the given address based on:

- Mailbox detection

- Syntax checks (RFC defined grammar)

- DNS validation

- Spell checks

- Email Service Provider (ESP) specific local-part grammar (if available).

Pricing details for Mailgun's email validation service can be found on our `pricing page`_.

Mailgun's email validation service is intended to validate email addresses submitted through forms like newsletters, online registrations and shopping carts.  Refer to our `Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)`_ for more information about how to use the service appropriately.

Different email validation rates are given based on the API endpoint. Both the public and private
API endpoints are limited to a burst per minute rate. The public endpoints have a default
limit of calls per month, which can be changed, to prevent abuse of the public API key.
The use of private API endpoints for email validation is encouraged and there is no limit past the initial
burst per minute rate. It is highly suggested that the private key is used whenever possible.

.. warning:: Do not use your Mailgun private API key on publicly accessible code. Instead, use your Mailgun public key, available in the "Security" tab under the **Account** section of the Control Panel.

.. code-block:: url

     GET /address/validate

Given an arbitrary address, validates address based off defined checks.

.. container:: ptable

 ====================== ========================================================
 Parameter         	Description
 ====================== ========================================================
 address           	An email address to validate. (Maximum: 512 characters)
 api_key          	If you cannot use HTTP Basic Authentication (preferred),
                   	you can pass your public api_key in as a parameter.
 mailbox_verification	If set to true, a mailbox verification check will be 
 			performed against the address.
 			
			The default is `False`.
 ====================== ========================================================

.. code-block:: url

    GET /address/parse

Parses a delimiter-separated list of email addresses into two lists: parsed addresses and unparsable portions. The parsed addresses are a list of addresses that are syntactically valid (and optionally pass DNS and ESP specific grammar checks). The unparsable list is a list of character sequences that could not be parsed (or optionally failed DNS or ESP specific grammar checks). Delimiter characters are comma (,) and semicolon (;).

.. container:: ptable

 ================= ========================================================
 Parameter         Description
 ================= ========================================================
 addresses         A delimiter separated list of addresses.
                   (Maximum: 8000 characters)
 syntax_only       Perform only syntax checks or DNS and ESP specific
                   validation as well. (true by default)
 api_key           If you cannot use HTTP Basic Authentication (preferred),
                   you can pass your public api_key in as a parameter.
 ================= ========================================================

.. code-block:: url

    GET /address/private/validate

Addresses are validated based off defined checks.

This operation is only accessible with the private API key and not subject to the
daily usage limits.

Example
~~~~~~~

Validate a single email address.

.. include:: samples/get-validate.rst

Simple sample response:

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
      "address": "foo@mailgun.net",
      "did_you_mean": null,
      "is_disposable_address": false,
      "is_role_address": true,
      "is_valid": true,
      "parts": {
          "display_name": null,
          "domain": "mailgun.net",
          "local_part": "foo"
      }
  }
  
Sample response with mailbox verification enabled:

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
      "address": "foo@mailgun.net",
      "did_you_mean": null,
      "is_disposable_address": false,
      "is_role_address": true,
      "is_valid": true,
      "mailbox_verification": "true",
      "parts": {
          "display_name": null,
          "domain": "mailgun.net",
          "local_part": "foo"
      }
  }
  
.. note:: is_valid returns true when an address is parsable, passes known grammar checks and an SMTP server is present. The role-based and disposable address check will not impact the state of the `is_valid` result. The user should determine whether or not to permit the address to be used.

.. note:: The mailbox verification attribute will return true if the email is valid, false if the email was invalid, or unknown if the SMTP request could not be completed. Unknown will also be returned if mailbox verification is not supported on the target mailbox provider. The outcome of the verification check will not impact the state of the is_valid result.

Parse a list of email addresses.

.. include:: samples/get-parse.rst

Sample response:

.. code-block:: javascript

	{
        "parsed": [
            "Alice <alice@example.com>",
            "bob@example.com"
        ],
        "unparseable": [
        ]
    }

jQuery Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We also have a `jQuery plugin`_ you can use for front-end email validation.

Just remember to use your public Mailgun API key.

.. _jQuery plugin: https://github.com/mailgun/validator-demo

Attaching to a form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   $('jquery_selector').mailgun_validator({
       api_key: 'api-key',
       in_progress: in_progress_callback, // called when request is made to validator
       success: success_callback,         // called when validator has returned
       error: validation_error,           // called when an error reaching the validator has occured
   });
