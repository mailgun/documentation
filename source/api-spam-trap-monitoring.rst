Spam Trap Monitoring
====================

Our `spam trap monitoring <https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413151071515-What-are-Spam-Traps>`_ service
surfaces how much of your email is being sent to known spam traps.

Add Domain
----------

This endpoint allows domains to be registered for spam trap monitoring. Please
note that your domain or subdomain must be verified before spam trap monitoring
can begin. Once your domain has been added, add the provided TXT record
(``txt_record``) to your domain configuration within your DNS provider. For
more details, see our documentation_. Following TXT record configuration, use
the `Verify Domain`_ endpoint to begin the domain verification process.

.. _documentation: https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026833053-Domain-Verification-Walkthrough

**NOTE:** If your domain is already verified for sending email via Mailgun, you
do not need to configure the provided TXT record. Instead, skip to the
`Verify Domain`_ section.

.. code-block:: url

    POST /v1/inboxready/domains

The available request fields are as follows:

.. container:: ptable

 ====================== ========================================================
 Field                  Description
 ====================== ========================================================
 ``domain``             Required. The domain or subdomain that you wish to add.
 ====================== ========================================================

Example 200 response:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "domain": {
       "ID": "<ID>",
       "created_at": 123456789,
       "name": "example.com",
       "verified": {
         "verified_at": 0,
         "status": "pending"
       },
       "services": {
         "spam_trap_monitoring": true
       },
       "txt_record": "<HASHED TXT RECORD KEY>"
     },
     "message": "The domain has been added"
   }

Verify Domain
-------------

Use this endpoint to start the domain verification process. When called, a
background process will begin to periodically attempt domain verification for
up to 24 hours.

Please note that domain verification is not instant. DNS verification typically
takes 1 hour to complete, but in some cases may take up to 24 hours to complete.
Feel free to check your DNS configuration for accuracy, but please allow for up
to 24 hours for the verification process to complete.

The `Get Domains`_ endpoint can be used to check verification status. On
verification success, the domain ``verified.status`` property will contain a
value of "inbox_ready" or "sending".

**NOTE:** In the case that your domain is already verified for sending email
via Mailgun, you will still need to use this endpoint to begin the verification
process. Your domain verification status will be inherited from Mailgun. Upon
verification, your domain's ``verified.status`` will be set to "sending". Please
note that in this scenario, verification is still performed via the background
process workflow and that there will be a ~1 hour delay in verification.
