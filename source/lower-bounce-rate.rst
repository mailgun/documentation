How to lower your bounce rate
=============================

Mailgun has thresholds in place that if exceeded will result in a domain being temporarily disabled. These limits are in place to **protect your email reputation** in case your system is compromised by a spammer or someone in your organization makes a large mistake.

If you do not have a good reputation tied to your domain and IP address, your email will not reach your recipients’ inboxes.

The number one reason we see people get blocked is because they have a **bad mailing list**. Most of these lists have bad email addresses and include spam traps. ESPs are good at recognizing bad mailing lists.

You can check your `logs`_ to see emails that are bouncing and check your `bounce list`_ for emails that we have stopped sending to as a result of bounces.

Best practices for lowering bounce rates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If you think your application has been compromised, change your SMTP credentials or API key through the `Mailgun control panel`_.
2. Clean your mailing list of invalid email addresses.
3. Only send emails to recipients that have signed up to receive them.
4. Verify the email address is correct with a confirmation email (aka, `confirmed opt-in`_).
5. We recommend using our `Email Validation API`_ at the point of signup to reduce invalid email addresses.
6. **Don’t** purchase your list or scrape websites for emails.

If your domain does get disabled, `contact support`_ after you have made the recommended changes above so we can re-enable your domain.
