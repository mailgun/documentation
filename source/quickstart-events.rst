How to start tracking email events
==================================

Once you start sending and receiving messages, it's important to track what's happening with them. Mailgun provides a variety of methods to access data about your emails, which you can read more about in the :ref:`tracking-messages` section of the :ref:`user-manual`. Below is a brief summary of Events, the Events API and Events Webhooks.

Events
------

Mailgun keeps track of every event that happens to every message (both inbound and outbound) and stores this data for at least 30 days for paid accounts and 2 days for free accounts.

Below is the table of events that Mailgun tracks.

You can access Events through a few interfaces:

* Webhooks (we POST data to your URL).
* The Events API (you GET data through the API).
* The ``Logs`` tab of the Control Panel (GUI).

**Events API**

You can programmatically query and download events through the :ref:`Events API <api-events>`:

.. include:: samples/events-date-time-recipient.rst

    }
  }

.. _quickstart-webhooks:

**Events Webhooks**

Mailgun can also make an HTTP POST to your URLs when events occur with your messages. If you would like Mailgun to POST event notifications, you need to provide a callback URL in the respective tab of the Control Panel. Webhooks are at the domain level so you can provide a unique URL for each domain by using the domain drop down selector.

You can read more about the data that is posted in the :ref:`webhooks` section of the :ref:`user-manual`. We recommend using `<http://bin.mailgun.net>`_ for creating temporary URLs to test and debug your webhooks.
