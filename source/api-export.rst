Exports
=======

Exports are a fast, asynchronous method for getting large amounts of data
from Mailgun without worrying about pagination. Any list in the Mailgun api
can be exported into a CSV file that is made available from s3.

Depending on the size of the data requested, this can take anywhere from a
few seconds to minutes. The status of an export can be periodically checked
by fetching it by id. Once it is in `complete` status, it is ready to be
download.


.. note:: Exports are available for 24 hours after creation
