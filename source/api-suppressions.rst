.. _api-suppressions:

Suppressions
############

Mailgun keeps three lists of addresses it blocks the delivery to: bounces,
unsubscribes and complaints. These lists are populated automatically as Mailgun
detects undeliverable addresses you try to send to and as recipients unsubscribe
from your mailings or mark your emails as a spam (for ESPs that provide FBL).
You can also add/remove addresses from any of these lists using the API.

.. note:: This is the documentation for the new Suppressions API. The documentation for the previous
          version (/v2) will temporarily be available here: :ref:`bounces <api-bounces-old>`,
          :ref:`unsubscribes <api-unsubscribes-old>`, :ref:`complaints <api-complaints-old>`.

.. _api-bounces:

Bounces
=======

Bounce list stores events of delivery failures due to permanent recipient
mailbox errors such as non-existent mailbox. Soft bounces (for example, mailbox
is full) and other failures (for example, ESP rejects an email because it
thinks it is spam) are not added to the list.

Subsequent delivery attempts to an address found in a bounce list are prevented
to protect your sending reputation.

Mailgun can notify your application every time a message bounces via
a :ref:`bounce webhook <um-tracking-bounces>`.
