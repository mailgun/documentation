Events
======

Mailgun tracks every event that happens to your emails and makes this data
available to you through the Events API. Mailgun retains this detailed data for
**two days** for free accounts and **30 days** for paid accounts. You can query
the data and traverse through the result pages as explained below.

.. code-block:: url

     GET /<domain>/events

.. note:: The Events API replaces the deprecated Logs API endpoint. You should
 use the Events API moving forward.

A request should define a time range and can specify a set of filters to apply.
In response, a page of events is returned along with URLs that can be used to
retrieve the next and previous result pages. To traverse the entire range, you
should keep requesting the next page URLs returned returned along with result
pages until an empty result page is reached.

Both next and previous page URLs are always returned, even when retrieving one
of them makes no sense. There are two such cases: previous page URL for the first
result page, and next page URL for the last result page; requesting these URLs
always returns an empty result page.

Time Range
----------

The request time range should be given by a beginning timestamp and either an
end timestamp or a search direction.

If the range end timestamp is provided then the relation between the beginning
and the end timestamps determines the direction in which events are going to be
traversed. E.g. if the end timestamp is less than the beginning timestamp, then
result pages are returned from newer to older and events on the pages are sorted
in the descending order of their timestamps.

If the end timestamp is not provided then depending on the range direction the
result page traversal behaves differently:

- If the range is descending then the end timestamp is determined by the user
  tariff plan retention period.
- If the range is ascending the it is extended all the time as the time goes on.
  So after the most recent events have been retrieved and an empty result page
  has been reached, then requesting next page URL returned with the last page
  some time later will return events that occurred since then. And this can go
  on indefinitely.

.. warning:: Even though it seems that real-time event polling can be
 implemented by traversing next URLs of an ascending time range that has no
 explicit end timestamp, it is not that simple! Please refer to `Event Polling`_
 for the proper way to do it.

If both the end range date and the direction of the search are specified then
they should agree with each other, otherwise the request will return an error.

Event Polling
-------------

In our system events are generated by physical hosts and follow different
routes to the event storage, therefore the order in which they appear in the
storage and become retrievable via the events API does not correspond to the
order in which they occur. A consequences of this is that page of most recent
events returned by the events API may not contain all the events that occurred
by that time. Some of them could still be on their way to the storage engine,
and when they are eventually indexed it would appear as if they got inserted
into an already retrieved page. This system behavior makes straight forward
implementation of event polling miss some events.

To ensure that all your events are retrieved and accounted for please
implement polling the following way:

1. Make a request to the events API specifying an ascending time range that
   begins some time in the past (e.g. half an hour ago);
2. Retrieve a result page;
3. Check the timestamp of the last event on the result page. If it is older
   then some threshold age (e.g. half an hour) then go to step (4), otherwise
   proceed with step (6);
4. The result page is trustworthy, use events from the page as you please;
5. Make a request using the next page URL retrieved with the result page,
   proceed with step (2);
6. Discard the result page for it is not trustworthy;
7. Pause for some time (at least 15 seconds);
8. Repeat the previous request, and proceed with step (2).

Query Options
-------------
URL parameters allow you to manipulate the results of your query:

.. container:: ptable

 ================= ============================================================
 Parameter         Description
 ================= ============================================================
 begin             The beginning of the search time range. It can be specified
                   as a string (see :ref:`date-format`) or linux epoch seconds.
                   Refer to `Time Range`_ for details.

 end               The end of the search time range. It can be specified
                   as a string (see :ref:`date-format`) or linux epoch seconds.
                   Refer to `Time Range`_ for details.

 ascending         Defines the direction of the search time range if the range
                   end time is not specified. Can be either ``yes`` or ``no``.
                   Refer to `Time Range`_ for details.

 limit             Number of entries to return. (300 max)

 **<field>**       **<field>** is the name of the `Filter Field`_. The value of
                   the parameter should be a valid `Filter Expression`_. Several
                   field filters can be specified in one request. If the same
                   field is mentioned, more then once, then all its filter
                   expressions are combined with **AND** operator.
 ================= ============================================================

Filter Field
------------
Log records can be filtered by the following fields:

.. container:: ptable

 ============= ================================================================
 Fields        Description
 ============= ================================================================
 event         An event type. For a complete list of all events written to the log
               see the `Event Types`_ table below.
 list          The email address of a mailing list the message was originally
               sent to.
 attachment    A name of an attached file.
 from          An email address mentioned in the `from` MIME header.
 message-id    A Mailgun message id returned by the messages API.
 subject       A subject line.
 to            An email address mentioned in the `to` MIME header.
 size          Message size. Mostly intended to be used with range filtering
               expressions (see below).
 recipient     An email address of a particular recipient. Even though a message
               may be addressed to several recipients, delivery is tracked on
               per recipient basis and every event pertains to only one recipient.
 tags          User defined tags.
 severity      Temporary or Permanent. Used to filter events based on severity, if
               exists. (Currently failed events only)
 ============= ================================================================

Filter Expression
-----------------
Possible filtering expressions are listed below:

.. container:: ptable

 ================= ============================================================
 Expression        Description
 ================= ============================================================
 foo bar           Matches field values that contain both term ``foo`` and
                   term ``bar``.
 foo AND bar       Same as above.
 foo OR bar        Matches field values that contain either term ``foo`` or
                   term ``bar``.
 "foo bar"         Matches field values that literally contain ``foo bar``.
 NOT foo           Matches field values that do not contain term ``foo``.
 >10000            Matches values that greater then ``10000``. This filter can
                   be applied to numeric fields only.
 >10000 <20000     Matches values that are greater then ``10000`` and less then
                   ``20000``. This filter can be applied to numeric fields only.
 ================= ============================================================

Note that more then one expression can be used as a filter value and parenthesis
can be used to specify grouping. E.g.: ``(Hello AND NOT Rachel) OR (Farewell AND Monica)``.

Event Types
-----------

Mailgun tracks all of the events that occur throughout the system. Below are
listed the events that you can retrieve using this API.

.. container:: ptable

 ================= ============================================================
 Event Type        Description
 ================= ============================================================
 accepted          Mailgun accepted the request to send/forward the email and the message
                   has been placed in queue.
 rejected          Mailgun rejected the request to send/forward the email.
 delivered         Mailgun sent the email and it was accepted by the recipient
                   email server.
 failed            Mailgun could not deliver the email to the recipient email server.
 opened            The email recipient opened the email and enabled image
                   viewing. Open tracking must be enabled in the Mailgun control
                   panel, and the CNAME record must be pointing to mailgun.org.
 clicked           The email recipient clicked on a link in the email.
                   Click tracking must be enabled in the Mailgun control
                   panel, and the CNAME record must be pointing to mailgun.org.
 unsubscribed      The email recipient clicked on the unsubscribe link.
                   Unsubscribe tracking must be enabled in the Mailgun control
                   panel.
 complained        The email recipient clicked on the spam complaint button within
                   their email client. Feedback loops enable the notification to
                   be received by Mailgun.

 stored            Mailgun has stored an incoming message
 ================= ============================================================

Event Structure
---------------

Events are represented as loosely structured JSON documents. The exact event
structure depends on the event type. But there are three fields that every
event has. They are as follows:

.. container:: ptable

 ================= ============================================================
 Field             Description
 ================= ============================================================
 event             The type of the event. Events of a particular type have an
                   identical structure, though some fields may be optional.
                   For the list of event types please refer to `Event Types`_.
 timestamp         The time when the event was generated in the system provided
                   as Unix epoch seconds.
 id                Event id. It is guaranteed to be unique within a day. It can
                   be used to distinguish events that have already been
                   retrieved when requests with overlapping time ranges are made.
 ================= ============================================================

Events can change their structure as new features are added to Mailgun, but we
only add new fields and never modify or remove existing one.
