.. _api-webhooks-deprecated:

Webhooks (deprecated)
=====================

.. Warning:: This refers to a previous version of the API which is deprecated
          and may be removed in a future release. Ongoing development of webhooks
          should be using the latest API available here: :ref:`api-webhooks`

.. Note:: If you are looking forward to migrate to the new Webhooks API, 
          you don’t need to worry: both APIs can be used at the same time.
          You’ll be notified by the legacy webhooks and the new webhooks.
          But don’t forget to remove the legacy url as soon as you get migrated your app to the new API!


This API allows you to create, access, and delete webhooks programmatically.

Supported webhooks, and their documentation, are listed below:

.. _api-drops-webhook-data-format:

Drops Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the ``Webhooks`` tab or programmaticaly using the API described above,
you can specify a URL to be notified every time a message is dropped.
There are a few reasons why Mailgun needs to stop attempting to deliver messages and drop them.
The most common reason is that Mailgun received a Hard bounce or repeatedly received Soft bounces 
and continuing attempting to deliver may hurt your reputation with the receiving ESP.
Also, if the address is on one of the 'do not send lists' because that recipient had previously 
bounced, unsubscribed, or complained of spam, we will not attempt delivery and drop the message.
If one of these events occur we will POST the following parameters to your URL:

.. container:: ptable

 ==================    ==================================================================================
 Parameter Name        Description
 ==================    ==================================================================================
 event                 Event name ("dropped").
 recipient             Intended recipient.
 domain                Domain that sent the original message.
 message-headers       String list of all MIME headers of the original message dumped to a JSON string (order of headers preserved).
 reason                Reason for failure. Can be one either "hardfail" or "old". See below.
 code                  ESP response code, e.g. if the message was blocked as a spam (optional).
 description           Detailed explanation of why the messages was dropped
 "custom variables"    Your own custom JSON object included in the header (see :ref:`manual-customdata`).
 timestamp             Number of seconds passed since January 1, 1970
 token                 Randomly generated string with length 50
 signature             String with hexadecimal digits generate by HMAC algorithm
 attachment-x          attached file (‘x’ stands for number of the attachment). Attachments are
                       included if the recipient ESP includes them in the bounce message. They are
                       handled as file uploads, encoded as multipart/form-data.
 ==================    ==================================================================================

- ``old`` indicates that Mailgun tried to deliver the message unsuccessfully for more than 8 hours.
- ``hardfail`` not delivering to an address that previously bounced, unsubscribed, or complained.

.. _api-deliveries-webhook-data-format:

Deliveries Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the ``Webhooks`` tab or programmaticaly using the API described above, you can specify
