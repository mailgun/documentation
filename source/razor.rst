Razor Error Codes
####################

Razor is Mailgun's reputation system for detecting spammers and phishers as well as improving deliverability for legitimate customers. Razor uses a host of signals to algorithmically detect messages that either look like spam or have been marked as spam, and shut them down. If your account has been shutdown by Razor, the below table will explain why Razor has shut your account down and the steps you can take to reactivate your account.

If you believe Razor has deactivated your account in error, please contact `Mailgun Support`_ and reference the Razor error code you received to speed up account reactivation.
